The folder `mahasangiti_yuttadhammo` contains the Pali texts as scraped from the World Tipitaka website by Yuttadhammo. They have been modified only by naming the files, arranging them by folder, and using Unicode instead of HTML entities. The contents are otherwise unchanged.

Note that an earlier version of this repo contained a `source` directory with another version of the same text. We discovered that there had been some textual duplication with that text. The current set is the tested and verified version.
